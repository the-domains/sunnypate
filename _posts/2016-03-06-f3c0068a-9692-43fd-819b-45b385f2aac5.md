## Real self - ideal self - fully
functional self

"Most of the luxuries and many of
the so-called comforts of life are not only not indispensable, but positive
hindrances to the elevation of mankind."--- Thoreau

Carl Rogers who I discussed in "Defining
Self-Actualization" discussed peoples growth potential, where ones aim was
to harmonize the "real self" with the "ideal self" to
emerge into a "fully functioning person." 

Most of the time environmental factors affect
people's ability to become self-actualized because there focus is merely just
to survive. Factors such as poverty, drug abuse, broken families, mental or
physical illness and more can all impact what is at the forefront of our minds
and create a road block towards us reaching our full potential. Environmental
factors though should not become an excuse for why you can't reach your full
potential. Many people have overcome adversity to achieve great things, some
examples are: Abraham Lincoln, Oprah Winfrey, Franklin Roosevelt, Malcolm X, and
Tennessee Williams - just to name a few.

**Defining "Real-Self"**

Psychologists define the real self as who we
actually are, how we think, feel, look, and act. 

****

**Defining "Ideal-Self"**

The ideal self is how we want to be, it's an
idealized image we developed based on what we have learned and experienced.
This image can include components of what our parents have taught us, what
society promotes, what we admire in other people, and what we think is in our
best interest.

_The closer the real self and ideal self are aligned the more at
peace one will be._

A fully functioning person is in touch with
their deepest feelings and desires, according to Carl Rogers. They understand
their emotions, trust their gut, and are unconditionally positive. Rogers
believed that a fully functioning person was a person who was always working
toward becoming self-actualized. A fully functioning person is open to life
experiences and adventures, can express themselves freely, is comfortable in
their skin and does not base their self worth on external factors. 

"He is able to live in his feelings and
reactions of the moment. He is not bound by the structure of his past
learning's, but these are a present resource for him insofar as they relate to
the experience of the moment. He lives freely, subjectively, in an existential
confrontation of this moment in life." (Rogers, 1962)

When you are a fully functioning person you
have a flexible view on self and experiences. Ones sense of self is consistent
with emotions and experiences, fully functioning individuals move in the
direction towards greater growth and fulfillment of one's own potential.

**Some ways to start living as a fully functioning individual:**

-Be present: live in the now. Eckhart Tolle
says: "Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry --- all forms of fear --- are cause
by too much future, and not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment,
grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of non-forgiveness are caused by
too much past, and not enough presence." 

-Trust your Intuition: Learn to love and
trust yourself, be tolerant and compassionate in every situation you encounter.
If you start taking time for yourself and start listening to your inner needs
you will be more in tune with what your body is trying to tell you and start
trusting it. 

-Be open: You are responsible for your life
and the way it turns out, but don't confuse this statement with control - we
are not in control but we can guide our lives towards living our best lives
possible. When you are living your passion success will be a byproduct in your
personal and professional life.
