_"Have the courage to follow your
heart and__intuition._They somehow already know what you
truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."__

-- Steve Jobs

Tips to figure out your true calling:

Figure out what you're passionate
about, a job that you would love to do that you would be willing to do it for
little or no pay. When you get up every morning and are looking forward to your
day and go to bed at night feeling satisfied with your work, that's when you
know you found the job you were supposed to have all along.

Know what you're capable of doing and
what your good at. Some of us are good with computers, others with people, some
with tools and so on. If you don't know your strengths there are a variety of
tools and resources to help you find this out.

Figure out the fields that you could
go into with your strengths and passions in mind; evaluate them based on
availability of jobs and what the job picture looks like for this industry over
the next 10-20 years. If you're unsure of the job market in this industry but
still want to dive in, do it, trust your gut.

Be a dedicated, smart, and hard
worker. You want to show your employer that you add value to the company and
that your unique skills are irreplaceable. This will be easy because you are
passionate about what you are doing and will undoubtedly excel.

Don't allow yourself to be a part of
the 87% of workers who are emotionally disconnected from their jobs.

Companies need to communicate with
their employees. Employees need to know what is expected of them, they need
praise when they do well, and encouragement to push forward. Management needs
to give employees the tools they need to be successful and to feel challenged
in their positions.

You then must decide what kind of
work environment you want to be in and what companies have the same ethics and
culture that align with your beliefs.

Know your value and don't settle for
anything less than the best!
